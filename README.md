# NBA-Randomizer
How will Free Agency and Trades shake up the NBA? Get an accurate simulation with the NBA Randomizer.

The NBA-Randomizer takes a random assortment of NBA players who got significant playing time last year and assigns them to the 30 teams.

It then uses ESPN's Real Plus-Minus to simulate the team's record in the new environment. I am planning to use RAPM, which goes back to 1990, so that players from the last 25 seasons can be used at random to increase the chaos. For now, though, it wil only utilize the 2014-15 season.
